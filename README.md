This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repo

First, you will need to clone the repo to use this project/app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikaswakde/pokemon-cards-app.git
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pokemon-cards-app
```

## Step 3: Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Step 3.0: Run the app on Android:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
- If you encounter issues, make sure you have the necessary Android development environment set up.
## Step 3.1: Run the app on ios:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
- If you encounter issues, make sure you have Xcode installed on your macOS machine.

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
